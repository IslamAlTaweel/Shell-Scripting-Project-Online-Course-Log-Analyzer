# Shell Scripting Project â€“ Online Course Log Analyzer

## Overview
The **Online Course Log Analyzer** is a Bash Shell script that processes session records stored in a file named log.txt. It offers a range of features to analyze course activity, including session details, attendance tracking, late arrivals, early departures, and instructor-related statistics. The tool is designed for interactive, menu-driven use, making it easy to explore and interpret course log data.

## Features
The script provides the following services:

1. Number of Sessions per Course
      - Displays the total number of sessions conducted for each course
      - Sorts the courses in decreasing order of session count

2. Average Attendance per Course
      - Computes the average number of students attending per session for a given course
      - Takes into account all sessions recorded in `log.txt`

3. List of Absent Students per Course
      - Shows students registered in a course who never attended any session
      - Requires a registration file for the course (`CourseID.txt`)

4. List of Late Arrivals per Session
      - Lists students who joined a session later than the allowed threshold (default 5 minutes)
      - Shows scheduled time versus actual join time

5. List of Students Leaving Early
      - Displays students who left a session at least 5 minutes before the end
      - Requires session start time and length from `log.txt`

6. Average Attendance Time per Student per Course
      - Calculates the average time each student spends in sessions for a specific course
      - Takes all attended sessions into account

7. Average Number of Attendances per Instructor
      - Computes the average number of students per session for each instructor
      - Aggregates data from all sessions in `log.txt`

8. Most Frequently Used Tool
      - Compares the usage of Zoom vs. Teams
      - Shows which tool is used more frequently based on session counts

9. Exit
      - Ends the program.

The shell script expects `log.txt` to be structured in a CSV ( comma seperated values ) formatted file consisting of the following fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1     | Tool Name (Zoom or Teams) |
| 2     | Student ID |
| 3     | First Name |
| 4     | Last Name |
| 5     | Instructor Name |
| 6     | Course Name |
| 7     | Session Date & Start Time |
| 8     | Session Length (minutes) |
| 9     | Session ID |
| 10    | Student Join Time |
| 11    | Student Leave Time |

## Execution Instructions

1. Ensure that `log.txt` and all course registration files (`CourseID.txt`) are in the same directory as the script.
2. Make the shell script executable:

```bash
