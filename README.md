# Shell Scripting Project â€“ Online Course Log Analyzer

## Overview
The **Online Course Log Analyzer** is a Bash Shell script that processes session records generated from online teaching platforms and stored in a file named log.txt. A wide range of features is offered for analyzing course activity, including session details, attendance tracking, late arrivals, early departures, and instructor-related statistics. The tool is designed for interactive, menu-driven use, making it easy for the user to explore and interpret online course log data.
