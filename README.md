# Shell Scripting Project â€“ Online Course Log Analyzer

## Overview
The **Online Course Log Analyzer** is a Bash Shell script that processes session records generated from online teaching platforms and stored in a file named log.txt. A wide range of features is offered for analyzing course activity, including session details, attendance tracking, late arrivals, early departures, and instructor-related statistics. The tool is designed for interactive, menu-driven use, making it easy for the user to explore and interpret online course log data.

      - Takes into account all sessions recorded in `log.txt`

3. List of Absent Students per Course

      - Requires a corresponding registration file named (`CourseID.txt`) for the course 

4. List of Late Arrivals per Session

      - Shows scheduled time versus actual join time

5. List of Students Leaving Early

      - Requires session start time and length from `log.txt`

6. Average Attendance Time per Student per Course
      - Calculates the average time each student spends in sessions for a specific course
      - Takes all attended sessions into account

7. Average Number of Attendances per Instructor
      - Computes the average number of students per session for each instructor
      - Aggregates data from all sessions in `log.txt`

## Log File Format (`log.txt`)
The shell script expects `log.txt` to be structured in a CSV ( comma seperated values ) formatted file consisting of the following fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|

| 2     | Student ID |
| 3     | First Name |
| 4     | Last Name |
| 5     | Instructor Name |
| 6     | Course Name |
| 7     | Session Date & Start Time |
| 8     | Session Length (minutes) |
| 9     | Session ID |
| 10    | Student Join Time |
| 11    | Student Leave Time |

## Execution Instructions 

1. Ensure that `log.txt` and all course registration files (`CourseID.txt`) are in the same directory as the script.
